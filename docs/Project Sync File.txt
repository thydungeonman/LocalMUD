# 🧠 LocalMUD Sync Prompt – Core Summary

**Project Name**: LocalMUD  
**Type**: Modular, persistent-world text-based game with emergent storytelling and parser-driven interaction  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python 3.x  
- Curses library (for CLI interface and screen handling)  
- Modular architecture  
- Accessibility-focused design  
> ⚠️ *Curses integration is functional but not deeply understood yet—screen handling may evolve as familiarity grows.*

## 🎯 Core Philosophy  
- Emphasizes player delight, cryptic lore, and hidden debug regions  
- Built for maintainability, extensibility, and playful meta-awareness  
- Prioritizes robust error handling, stat clarity, and immersive feedback  

## 🧩 Key Features  
- Modular room and region system with persistent overworld  
- Parser with tolerant input handling and debug breadcrumbs  
- Stat display polish with full names and modifiers  
- Minigames (e.g. blackjack, slots) integrated into game world  
- Seasonal features and MOTDs (e.g. April Fools events)  
- Monster management and combat modules with auto-indexing  
- Settings menu with persistent toggles (e.g. debug mode)  
- Cryptic jokes and lore scattered in documentation

# 🧠 LocalMUD Sync Prompt – Architecture & Development Notes

## 🧠 Parser Architecture  
- Single-file parser (`parser.py`) with monolithic `handle_command()` function  
- All commands handled as clauses within this one function  
> ⚠️ *May need refactoring as command count grows*

## 🌍 Region/Room Loading  
- Each region is its own Python file  
- `overworld.py` acts as the central loader/coordinator  
- Rooms are loaded modularly to support future modding  

## 📜 Game Rules System  
- Strictly follows B/X D&D rules (Basic/Expert Dungeons & Dragons)  
- Character progression: levels, equipment, stats all per B/X handbook  
- Combat mechanics align with B/X system  

## 💾 Persistence Model  
- Player characters: Saveable/loadable (system TBD)  
- World state: Persistent elements like graves from past characters  
> ⚠️ *Save system not yet implemented*

## 🔧 Current Development State  
- **ACTIVE WORK**: Implementing combat system for the first time  
- **BROKEN/WIP**: Debug logging system (non-functional)  
- **PRIMARY GOAL**: Fully accessible text-based D&D for blind players via screen readers  
- **LONG-TERM**: Indefinite expansion with modular content  

## 🧱 Known Technical Debt  
- Save/load system needs implementation  
- Debug breadcrumb logging non-functional  
- Curses usage is functional but implementation details need deeper understanding  
- Parser's monolithic structure may need refactoring
