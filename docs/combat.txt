So where we left off, 
-we have a monster. We decided to keep monster data in game/monsters.py (Kobold only to start).
-We created a testing region that doesnt appear in the normal game without using debug teleport.
-We made the decision that we want to make combat run in the normal parser (similar to how Beyond Zork handled combat) instead of using a mini game.
-Ability modifiers are now thier own easily referencable variables.

So where do we go from here? Start by making it so instances of monsters can appear in the game? I know I want to have the monster spawn info be held in the region info. (Hence the test area)

Note that regions are kept in world/. overworld.py acts as a loader for all the various region files. 

I'm wondering if we should revamp the old NPC mechanics as well. NPCs appearing and monsters appearing could be handled the same way. I dunno I havent figured that part out yet. NPCs behave very differet, but non-story specific NPCs should have a chance to appear in certain areas and there could be some crossover potential there.
