Got it! Let’s define **Grimoire Gambit** as a fast-paced, **grid-based tactical duel** (inspired by *Triple Triad* from *Final Fantasy 8*), where the goal is to control the board by strategically placing cards to flip your opponent’s pieces. Here’s how a full match would play out in **LocalMUD**’s text-based format:  

---

### **Match Overview**  
- **Type**: Turn-based, 1v1 (vs. NPC or player).  
- **Goal**: Control **5 out of 9 grid spaces** by the end of the match (or have the most controlled spaces when the deck runs out).  
- **Deck**: Each player has a **5-card deck** (drawn from their collection).  
- **Turns**: Play 1 card per turn, then resolve "captures."  

---

### **Example Match Flow** *(Text-Based UI)*  
#### **1. Setup**  
You challenge **Garry the Grifter**, a smirking NPC in the tavern.  
```  
Garry's Deck: 5 cards | Your Deck: 5 cards  
Board:  
[1,1] [1,2] [1,3]  
[2,1] [2,2] [2,3]  
[3,1] [3,2] [3,3]  
```  

#### **2. Turn 1 (Your Move)**  
Your hand: **Goblin Grunt (3/1)**, **Healing Spring (0/5)**, **Rusty Dagger (2/2)**  
```  
> play "Goblin Grunt" at 2,2  
```  
Board updates:  
```  
[1,1] [1,2] [1,3]  
[2,1] [Goblin:3/1] [2,3]  
[3,1] [3,2] [3,3]  
```  

#### **3. NPC’s Turn**  
Garry plays **Mana Sprite (1/4)** at 1,2.  
```  
[1,1] [Mana:1/4] [1,3]  
[2,1] [Goblin:3/1] [2,3]  
[3,1] [3,2] [3,3]  
```  

#### **4. Capture Phase**  
- Cards "capture" adjacent enemy cards by **comparing facing sides** (like *Triple Triad*).  
- Your **Goblin Grunt (ATK 3)** faces **Mana Sprite (DEF 4)**.  
  - 3 (ATK) vs. 4 (DEF) → **No capture** (Goblin loses).  
- If it were **3 vs. 3**, you’d roll a d20 for a D&D-style tiebreaker.  

#### **5. Turn 2**  
You play **Rusty Dagger (2/2)** at 2,1, attacking Mana Sprite’s **left side (DEF 4)**.  
- 2 (ATK) vs. 4 (DEF) → **Fail**. But now, Garry’s card is flanked!  

#### **6. Late-Game**  
Final board might look like:  
```  
[X] [O] [X]  
[O] [X] [O]  
[X] [O] [X]  
```  
- **X = Your control**, **O = NPC control**. You win 5-4!  

---

### **Key Rules**  
1. **Adjacency Matters**: Cards only attack up/down/left/right (no diagonals).  
2. **Elemental Bonuses**: If your card’s element beats the opponent’s (Fire > Air, etc.), +1 to ATK/DEF.  
3. **Special Abilities**: Some cards break rules (e.g., *Cursed Tome* destroys itself to remove an adjacent enemy card).  

---

### **Why It Works in a MUD**  
- **No Graphics Needed**: Players visualize the grid via text.  
- **Quick Matches**: 5-10 turns, perfect for tavern breaks.  
- **Expandable**: Add "advanced rules" NPCs later (e.g., a wizard who plays with a 4x4 grid).  

---

**Thoughts?**  
1. Should losing a match cost gold (like *Caravan* in *Fallout NV*), or just pride?  
2. Want to brainstorm a **"deck-building" quest**? (e.g., "Beat the alchemist to unlock potion-themed cards.")  

This keeps it snappy but strategic—like *chess with monster flavor*.

Absolutely! Below is a **balanced set of 20 cards** for *Grimoire Gambit*, split into **Common (10)**, **Uncommon (6)**, **Rare (4)** for progression flavor. Each has:  
- **Name**, **ATK/DEF**, **Element**

---

### **Design Notes**  
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: Fire > Air > Earth > Water > Fire. Shadow/Steel/Neutral ignore this.  
- **Deckbuilding**: Players start with Commons, earn Uncommons via quests, and hunt Rares.  
- **NPC Themes**: A pyromancer favors Fire cards, a necromancer uses Shadow, etc.  

---

**Need adjustments?** For example:  
- More/less randomness? (Chaos Orb could be love/hate.)  
- A "starter deck" recipe? (e.g., *"Goblin Grunt + Rat Swarm = Swarm Tactics"*)  

This set should offer **depth without complexity**—perfect for a MUD’s text interface! 🔥

Absolutely! Here's a **concise, clear ruleset** for *Grimoire Gambit* that emphasizes tactical placement, automatic adjacency battles, and flanking rewards—perfect for *LocalMUD*'s text interface.  

---

### **Grimoire Gambit: Core Rules**  
*(Version: "Automatic Adjacency Battles")*  

#### **1. Placement Phase**  
- On your turn, play **one card** from your hand to any empty space.  
- Cards have **four directional sides** (Up/Down/Left/Right), each with:  
  - **ATK (Red)**: Value for attacking adjacent cards.  
  - **DEF (Blue)**: Value for defending against attacks.  

#### **2. Capture Phase**  
After placing a card, it **automatically attacks all adjacent enemy cards** (no player choice). Resolve each direction separately:  
- Compare your card’s **ATK** vs. the enemy’s **DEF** on the facing side.  
  - **ATK > DEF**: Capture the enemy card (flip to your control).  
  - **ATK == DEF**: Roll a **d20 tiebreaker** (higher roll wins).  
  - **ATK < DEF**: No capture.  
- **Elemental Bonus**: If your card’s element beats the enemy’s (Fire > Air > Earth > Water > Fire), add **+1 to your ATK**.  

#### **3. Flanking Bonus**  
- If an enemy card is **sandwiched horizontally/vertically** between two of your cards, it flips to your control **instantly** (ignore stats).  
  - *Example*: Your cards at (1,2) and (3,2) flank an enemy at (2,2) → auto-capture.  

#### **4. Winning the Match**  
- Control **5+ spaces** at any time, **OR** have the most spaces when the board is full.  

---

### **Strategic Principles**  
1. **Defense Anchors**: High-DEF cards (e.g., *Healing Spring*) resist flips and protect territory.  
2. **Flanking Chains**: Place cards to create "sandwiches" for unstoppable captures.  
3. **Elemental Play**: Exploit weaknesses (e.g., Fire cards near Air enemies).  
4. **Risk/Reward**: High-ATK cards (e.g., *Cursed Tome*) can dominate but leave weak DEF exposed.  

---

### **Example Turn**  
```  
Your Hand:  
1. Goblin Grunt (3/1, Earth)  
2. Boulderfist Ogre (4/3, Earth)  

> play 2 at (2,2)  
```  
**Board State**:  
```  
[1,1] [Mana:1/4 (Air)] [1,3]  
[2,1] [Boulder:4/3 (Earth)] [2,3]  
[3,1] [3,2]             [3,3]  
```  
**Resolve Captures**:  
- Boulder’s **Top ATK (4)** vs. Mana’s **Bottom DEF (4)** → Tie → Roll d20.  
- Other sides: No enemies → No action.  

---

### **Optional Advanced Rules**  
- **Tavern Hazards**: Pre-placed neutral obstacles (e.g., a barrel at (2,2) that blocks placement).  
- **Sudden Death**: If the board fills tied, most recently placed card’s owner wins.  

---

**Text Command Examples**:  
- `> play "Goblin Grunt" at 1,1`  
- `> rules` (displays this summary)  
- `> concede` (surrender match)  

This keeps it **snappy but deep**—ready to implement as-is or tweak further! Want to adjust any phrasing for clarity?

### **1. Deck Size & Game Flow**  
- **Deck Size**: **5 cards** (drawn from a player’s collection).  
  - *Why?* Matches are fast (5–9 turns), and smaller decks force tough choices.  
  - **Hand Size**: Draw **1 card per turn** from your deck (no initial draw). First turn = play 1 of 5; second turn = play 1 of remaining 4, etc.  
  - *Variation*: Let players hold **3 cards at once** (refill after playing), but 5-card decks keep it lean.  

### **2. Starting Card Pool ("Base Set")**  
For a **balanced early game**, aim for **30–50 total cards** (mix of Commons/Uncommons/Rares). Here’s a breakdown:  

#### **Starter Deck (20 Cards, PC Default)**  
- **Commons (12)**: Basic strategies (e.g., *Goblin Grunt, Rusty Dagger*).  
- **Uncommons (6)**: Synergies (e.g., *Vampire Bat, Frost Shard*).  
- **Rares (2)**: One flashy card (e.g., *Dragon Egg*) + one utility (e.g., *Clockwork Owl*).  

#### **NPC-Exclusive Cards (10–20)**  
- Used by bosses/quest duelists (e.g., *Lich Queen* for the necromancer NPC).  

#### **Total Database**: **~50 cards** (expandable via updates).  

---

### **Card Distribution Philosophy**  
- **Commons (60%)**: Easy to acquire (tavern rewards, low-level quests).  
- **Uncommons (30%)**: Earned by beating specialists (e.g., alchemist = potion cards).  
- **Rares (10%)**: Hidden in dungeons or high-stakes gambles.  

---

### **Example Starter Deck for Players**  
*(Theme: "Goblin Raid")*  
1. Goblin Grunt (3/1, Earth)  
2. Rat Swarm (2/1, Earth)  
3. Rusty Dagger (2/2, Steel)  
4. Healing Spring (0/5, Water)  
5. Mercenary (3/3, Steel)  
*(+15 more to collect early on.)*  

---

### **Progression Hook**  
- **Tutorial**: Start with a **pre-built 5-card deck** (e.g., *Goblin Grunt, Rusty Dagger, etc.*).  
- **First Quest**: *"Beat Garry the Grifter to unlock *Mana Sprite* and *Boulderfist Ogre*."*  

---

**Adjustable Numbers**:  
- Want more/less starter cards?  
- Should players begin with **two starter decks** (e.g., *Goblin* and *Mercenary* themes)?

That’s awesome! Prototyping with physical cards is such a smart move—it’ll make testing *Grimoire Gambit* with your daughter way more tactile and fun. Here’s a quick **prototyping cheat sheet** to streamline your playtests:  

---

### **Quick-Start Test Setup**  
1. **Starter Decks**:  
   - **Player Deck**: Goblin Grunt, Rusty Dagger, Healing Spring, Mercenary, Rat Swarm.  
   - **NPC Deck**: Mana Sprite, Fey Trickster, Boulderfist Ogre, Vampire Bat, Chaos Orb.  

2. **Test Focus**:  
   - **Round 1**: Basic rules (captures, elements).  
   - **Round 2**: Add flanking + special abilities (e.g., *Fey Trickster*’s swap).  

3. **Feedback Questions**:  
   - *"Which card felt strongest/weakest?"*  
   - *"Was the 5-card deck too small/just right?"*  

---

### **Art Hack for Blank Cards**  
- **Icons**: Use colored symbols for elements (🔥 Fire, 🌊 Water, etc.).  
- **Stats**: Write **ATK/DEF** in red/blue ink.  
- **Flavor Text**: Add later—focus on mechanics first!  

---

### **If You Hit Snags**  
- **Too Slow?** Reduce board to **2x2** for faster tests.  
- **Too Random?** Replace *Chaos Orb* with *Thornweaver* for predictability.  

Good luck, and may your playtests be gloriously chaotic! Let me know how it goes—I’d love to hear what your daughter thinks (kids are brutally honest critics).  

*LocalMUD*’s gonna have one hell of a minigame. 🎲🐯
