# LocalMUD

LocalMUD is a modular, parser-driven RPG with a retro sensibility and creeping metaphysics. Built in Python, it blends old-school MUD mechanics with narrative-driven exploration, stat-based character creation, and the persistent presence of the Echo Sovereign.

This is a personal game project developed by Alex, originally sparked by a desire to explore flexible worldbuilding and parser logic while drinking questionable amounts of tea.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Run `main.py` to begin the game
- Navigate using text commands (e.g. `go north`, `take orb`, `look`)
- Use `about` or `title` in-game for flavor and system info

Requires Python 3.13+ and a terminal capable of running curses-based interfaces.

## Features

- Character creation with stat rolling, modifiers, and class/background selection
- Immersive intro narration and a message log that scrolls with parser output
- Top bar UI that dynamically displays player HP and orb status
- Glowing Orb logic integrated into early gameplay
- The Oracle and Echo Sovereign factions teased in opening lore

## Roadmap

Milestones that guide LocalMUD’s evolution—where mechanics grow from echoes into myth.



### v0.8.5 — “Persistence”
The Echo Sovereign watches what you remember.

- Save/load system with full player state tracking
- Postmortem screens: summaries on death
- Unlockables: backgrounds, starter items, hidden flags
- Orb modifiers: corrupted/benevolent seeds change world flavor
- Expanded NPC behavior: dialogue trees, memory-aware responses

### v0.8.6 — “Voices in the Stone” *(Tentative)*
The world speaks with intent.

- Help system for all parser commands
- Conversational NPCs: respond to location, inventory, and XP
- Ambient whispers: Sovereign commentary during key events
- Begin journaling system: player-written notes or lore discovery
- Prepare for first public beta build / code being released to the public.

### v0.8.7 — “The Hollow Accord" *(Tentative)*
Faction diplomacy, regional events

### v0.8.6 — “Ashes of the First Seed* *(Tentative)*
World reset, legacy mechanics, seasonal cycles

## Lore Fragments

- The Oracle once served Eldermere, now slumbers in its ruined chapel
- The Glowing Orb reactivates ancient forces—but also awakens the Echo Sovereign
- The Echo Sovereign speaks in recursion, rewrites rooms, and seeks to collapse reality into looping memory
- Your character is the town's last hope for restoration—but their journey will reshape more than geography

## Design Philosophy

LocalMUD is built to be modular, accessible, and weird. It favors player expression, thematic consistency, and a sense of humor. Every stat, item, and room is a chance to tell a story.

The parser is lightweight. The lore is deep. The spoon is bent.

## Ewoks

Ewoks are rad as hell. They had those two movies that were supposed to be for kids, but I remember them starting with the death of a parent. Really dark stuff. Anyway, you ever notice how Ewoks are half as tall as Wookies, an the name is the same but cut in half and backwards? Weird stuff man. I also read that the handglider scene in Return of the Jedi was supposed to be much gorier but they had to tone it down in order to maintain a PG rating. Wookieepedia talks about it a little bit. I just find it endlessly facsinating that these little walking teddy bears are so well versed in dealing death.
